# üß¨ FastaKrakenizer

FastaKrakenizer builds a **custom Kraken2 database** from a plain FASTA file ‚Äî without needing NCBI's `names.dmp`, `nodes.dmp`, or `accession_list.txt`.

It also optionally post-processes a Kraken2 classification report by replacing **TaxIDs** with readable **FASTA header names** using a generated flat taxonomy.

---

## üìÑ Why Use This Tool?

Kraken2 reports use TaxIDs (numeric) which are uninformative in custom databases. This tool:

- Creates a **flat taxonomy**, where each FASTA header is treated as its own species.
- Assigns **custom TaxIDs** (e.g. starting from 9000000+).
- Replaces TaxIDs in Kraken2 reports with corresponding species names (FASTA headers).

Ideal for:  
- Simulated reads  
- Plasmids, ARGs, mobile elements  
- Custom isolate genomes

## üìÅ Required Inputs

1. **FASTA file** ‚Äî e.g., `custom.fasta`  
2. *(Optional)* **Kraken2 Report (`report.txt`)**

---
## Installation

git clone https://github.com/arpit20328/FastaKrakenizer.git


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### üîπ Build Kraken2 DB only:

```bash
bash custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh custom.fasta kraken_custom_flat 9000000
```

### üîπ Build DB + post-process Kraken2 report:

```bash
bash custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh custom.fasta kraken_custom_flat 9000000 report.txt
```
