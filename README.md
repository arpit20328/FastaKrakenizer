# 🧬 FastaKrakenizer
This tool (bash script) describes how to make custom kraken2 index only from a fasta reference file without requierment of  (`names.dmp`) or  (`nodes.dmp`)  or  (`accession_list.txt`).

Further it postprocess a Kraken2 classification report by replacing the **TaxID column** with actual species or sequence names using a custom taxonomy (`names.dmp`) file.

---

## 📄 Importance of This tool 

Kraken2 reports classification results per taxon using **TaxIDs** (typically in column 5). If you're using a **custom Kraken2 database** (e.g., built from a FASTA of specific bacterial or fungal genes), these taxids may not be informative by themselves.

To improve readability, this pipeline maps those taxids back to the **original FASTA headers or species names** using the `names.dmp` file.

## 📁 Required Files

1. **Kraken2 Report (`kraken_report.txt`)**  
   This is the default output of Kraken2. Each line typically includes:
   - Percentage of reads
   - Number of reads assigned
   - Number of reads directly assigned
   - Taxonomic rank (e.g. `S` for species)
   - TaxID
   - (optional) blank column or name if available

2. **names.dmp**  
   A custom taxonomy file created during Kraken2 database construction. It links TaxIDs to species names or FASTA headers. Each entry typically looks like:


## Usage

## 🧪 Usage

### 🔹 Build Custom Kraken2 Flat Database (No Report Yet)

```bash
bash custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh custom.fasta kraken_custom_flat 9000000

### 🔹 Build Custom Kraken2 Flat Database (With Kraken report (taxid-to-name replacement))

```bash
bash  custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh  custom.fasta  kraken_custom_flat  9000000  report.txt
