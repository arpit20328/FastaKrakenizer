# üß¨ FastaKrakenizer

FastaKrakenizer builds a **custom Kraken2 database** from a plain FASTA file ‚Äî without needing NCBI's `names.dmp`, `nodes.dmp`, or `accession_list.txt`.

It also optionally post-processes a Kraken2 classification report by replacing **TaxIDs** with readable **FASTA header names** using a generated flat taxonomy.

---

## üìÑ Why Use This Tool?

Kraken2 reports use TaxIDs (numeric) which are uninformative in custom databases. This tool:

- Creates a **flat taxonomy**, where each FASTA header is treated as its own species.
- Assigns **custom TaxIDs** (e.g. starting from 9000000+).
- Replaces TaxIDs in Kraken2 reports with corresponding species names (FASTA headers).

Ideal for:  
- Simulated reads  
- Plasmids, ARGs, mobile elements  
- Custom isolate genomes

## üìÅ Required Inputs

1. **FASTA file** ‚Äî e.g., `custom.fasta`  
2. *(Optional)* **Kraken2 Report (`report.txt`)**

## Prerequisite
1. Kraken2 : Install via conda

```bash

   conda install -c bioconda kraken2

```
2. BBMask : Install via following commands:

```bash
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/files/latest/download -O bbtools.tar.gz
tar -xvzf bbtools.tar.gz
mv bbtools ~/bbtools
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/bbtools' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

```

## Installation
```bash

git clone https://github.com/arpit20328/FastaKrakenizer.git


```
## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### üîπ Build Kraken2 DB only:

```bash
bash custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh <input_fasta> <kraken_db_dir> <starting_taxid> [<threads>]

bash custom_kraken2_flat_db.sh custom.fasta kraken_custom_flat 9000000  64

```

| Column Index | Meaning                                  | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Percentage of reads assigned             | Percentage of total reads classified to this taxon or below it (including descendants). |
| 2            | Number of reads classified to this taxon | Number of reads classified directly to this taxon or its descendants.                   |
| 3            | Number of reads classified directly here | Reads classified exactly to this taxon (not including descendants).                     |
| 4            | Taxonomic rank code                      | Single-letter code indicating taxonomic rank (e.g., `S` = species, `U` = unclassified). |
| 5            | NCBI Taxonomy ID (taxid)                 | Numeric taxonomy identifier assigned by NCBI taxonomy database.                         |
| 6            | Taxon name                               | The scientific name or label for this taxon (e.g., species name, or "unclassified").    |

## Replacing taxid names with Inpur FASTA Headers

If You want to replace the 5th column in a Kraken2 report (or similar file) ‚Äî which usually contains taxonomic IDs or names ‚Äî with your input FASTA headers by using the names.dmp file by following command: 

```bash

awk -F '\t' 'NR==FNR { taxid_name[$1]=$3; next } { if ($5 in taxid_name) $5=taxid_name[$5]; print }' names.dmp kraken2_report.txt > kraken2_report_with_names.txt


```
